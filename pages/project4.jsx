                <p>My entire <span className="text-red-500">verve</span> - is a dark verse.</p>
                <p>It will take you - to the unending dawn of blooms, flight and light.</p>
                <p>In this verse, I heaved you a <span className="text-red-500">sigh</span>, sigh.</p>
                <p>In this verse, I tied you to trees, water and <span className="text-red-500">flames</span>.</p>
                <p>Life perhaps, is that long, shady road, where every day, a woman wanders - with her basket of fruits.</p>
                <p>
                    Life perhaps, is that <span className="text-red-500">rope</span>; the one that a man would hang himself with -
                    in a gray, rainy day - from a thick branch.
                </p>
                <p>Life perhaps, is that child who is running back home.</p>
                <p>
                    Life perhaps, is those brief <span className="text-red-500">smokes</span>, in the lazy, idle times -
                    stolen from two making-loves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life perhaps, is that still instant, when my eyes sink into -
                    the reflection of your sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life perhaps, is its sheltering sense; I will merge it - with the flood of <span className="text-red-500">moonlight</span> -
                    and the frozen abode of night.
                </p>
                <p>In my little, lonely room, my heart is invaded - by the silent crowd of love.</p>
                <p>
                    I am keeping track of my life: The beautiful decay of a <span className="text-red-500">rose</span>, in this antique vase;
                    the growing plant that you brought, and those birds in their timber cage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are singing every hour, up to the full depth - of their view.
                </p>
                <p>
