                <p>We are the time. We are the famous metaphor from Heraclitus the Obscure.</p>
                <p>We are the water, not the hard diamond, the one that is lost, not the one that stands <span className="text-red-500">still</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    We are the river and we are that Greek that looks himself into the river. His reflection
                    changes into the waters of the changing mirror, into the crystal that changes like the <span className="text-red-500">fire</span>.
                </p>
                <p>We are the vain predetermined river, in his travel to his sea.</p>
                <p>The shadows have surrounded him. Everything said goodbye to us, everything goes  <span className="text-red-500">away</span>.</p>

                <p>
                    However, there is something that stays, however, there is something that <span className="text-red-500">bemoans</span>.
