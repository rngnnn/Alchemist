                <p>We are the time. We are the famous metaphor from Heraclitus the Obscure.</p>
                <p>We are the water, not the hard diamond, the one that is lost, not the one that stands <span className="text-red-500">still</span>.</p>

                    We are the river and we are that Greek that looks himself into the river. His reflection
